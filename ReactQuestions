ChatGPT said:
Hello, Master Ray 👋
Here are common React interview practical questions that are actually asked in interviews, especially for intern / fresher / junior roles. I’m giving them in task-based format, so you know what to practice, not just theory.

🔹 1. Counter App (State + Events)
Task:
Create a counter with Increment, Decrement, Reset buttons.

They check:

useState

Event handling

Re-render understanding

👉 Follow-up they ask:

Why state update is async?

🔹 2. Conditional Rendering
Task:
Show Login / Logout button based on user login state.

They check:

Ternary operator

Conditional JSX

{isLoggedIn ? <Logout /> : <Login />}
🔹 3. Todo List (MOST IMPORTANT) ⭐
Task:

Add todo

Delete todo

Mark as completed

They check:

Array state updates

map, filter

Keys in React

👉 Follow-up:

Why key is important?
Why not use index as key?

🔹 4. Form Handling
Task:
Create a form with name + email, show data on submit.

They check:

Controlled components

onChange

preventDefault

🔹 5. useEffect – API Call
Task:
Fetch data from API and display list.

They check:

useEffect

Dependency array

Side effects

👉 Trap question:

What happens if dependency array is empty?

🔹 6. Search Filter
Task:
Search input → filter list in real time.

They check:

Derived state

Performance thinking
